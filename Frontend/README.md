## âš¡ How it Works

1. User types a message and presses **Enter** or clicks the **Send** button.
2. Frontend sends the message along with the current session ID to the backend `/chat` API.
3. Backend returns an AI-generated response along with an updated session ID.
4. Chat messages are displayed with proper styling:
   - **User messages**: Gradient background, right-aligned, shadowed for a premium feel.
   - **AI messages**: White/gray background, left-aligned with bot icon.
5. Typing indicator shows while AI is generating a response.
6. Users can reset the chat, clearing messages and session data.
